# PROJECT: IMAGE RECOGNITION-BASED WASTE SORTING SYSTEM 

Our team has developed a mobile application aimed at aiding waste classification through photos taken from smartphones. Recognizing the significance of waste classification in waste treatment, recycling, and reuse efforts, our application utilizes the MobileNetV2 model converted into TensorFlow Lite format. This model facilitates the recognition and classification of waste into four main groups: dangerous waste, recyclable waste, various types of glass waste, and organic waste along with other types of waste.

## Data Collection and Training 

Dataset: Utilized a dataset comprising nearly 12,000 images of 38 different types of waste items.
Data Enhancement: Enhanced the dataset by collecting additional images and refining existing ones to improve model performance.
Training Accuracy: Achieved a training set accuracy of 97.68% and a testing (validation) set accuracy of 93.20%, thanks to the comprehensive dataset and effective training methods employed.
